Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.

A deck is made up of individual cards, each of which have their own rank, suit, and point value.

Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);

The deck contains 6 cards. One of each rank for each suit. 3 ranks * 2 suits = 6 cards.

The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2,.., 10 are 2,..., 10, respectively. Specify the contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues); initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.

String[] ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "jack", "queen", “king”, “ace” };
String[] suits = {"heart", "spade", “diamond”, “club”};
int[] pointValues = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11};
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);

Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter?

The order of ranks and points matter because the point values correspond to the rank via their index. The order of suits does not matter.
